We will discuss how the behavior of the model introduced in
\refcite{Ricottone2020} for the limit of weak coupling and an infinite
bath may be reproduced with both finite coupling strength and a finite
number of bath levels.

The model Hamiltonian is that of an SSH-Chain~\cite{Su1979} with a
number of bath states coupled to each unit cell \(H=H_{A}+H_{\bar{A}}+V\)
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:36}
  H_{A} &= ∑_{m}ω_{A} \ketbra{A,m} \\
  H_{\bar{A}} &= Σ_{m}(ω_{A} + ω)\ketbra{B,m}+
                   ∑_{j}\bqty{ω_{j}\ketbra{j, k} + g_{j}
                   \pqty{\ketbra{j,m}{B,m} + \hc}}\\
  V&=∑_{m} v\pqty{\ketbra{A,m}{B,m} + u\ketbra{A,m}{B,m+1} + \hc}
\end{align}

In momentum space, the model Hamiltonian takes the form \(H=H_{A}(k) +
H_{\bar{A}}(k) + V(k)\) with
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:35}
  H_{A}(k) &= ω_{A} \ketbra{A,k} \\
  H_{\bar{A}}(k) &= (ω_{A} + ω)\ketbra{B,k}+
                   ∑_{j}\bqty{ω_{j}\ketbra{j, k} + g_{j}
                   \pqty{\ketbra{j,k}{B,k} + \hc}}\\
  V(k)&=\abs{v(k)}\pqty{\eu^{\iu ϕ(k)}\ketbra{A,k}{B,k} + \hc}
\end{align}
with \(v(k) = \abs{v (1+u\eu^{\iu k})}\).

Upon eliminating the \(B\) site from the above through a
Schrieffer-Wolff transformation for \(ω\gg v(k)\), we end up with
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:37}
  H(k) = \tilde{ω}_{A} \ketbra{j,k} + ∑_{j} \bqty{\tilde{ω}_{j} \ketbra{j, k}
    + \pqty{\tilde{η}_{j}\ketbra{A,k}{j,k} + \hc}},
\end{equation}
where the \(\tilde{η}_{j}(k) \sim \tilde{η}_{j}(0) v(k)\). The tildas
signify quantities renormalized due to the Schrieffer-Wolff transform
and will be dropped in the following.


The \emph{mean displacement} is defined as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:38}
  \ev{m(t)} \equiv ∑_{m}m \pqty{1-ρ_{A,m}}  = ∑_{m}m \pqty{1-\abs{\braket{A,m}{ψ(t)}}^{2}}
\end{equation}
where we consider the initial condition \(\ket{ψ(0)}=\ket{A,0}\) and
define \(ρ_{A}(t)=\abs{\braket{A,m}{ψ(t)}}^{2}\) for convenience.

As the quantity \(\ev{m(t)}\) can fluctuate in time and we will be
interested in long-time beahavior, we additionally define
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:39}
  \ev{m} \equiv \lim_{T\to ∞} \frac{1}{T}∫_{0}^{T}\ev{m(t)} \dd{t}
\end{equation}
which we will refer to as \ac{mlong}.

In momentum space this becomes
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:40}
  \ev{m} = ∫_{0}^{2π}(1-ρ_{A})\pdv{ϕ(k)}{k} \frac{\dd{k}}{2π}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:41}
  ρ_{A}(k) = \lim_{T\to ∞}\frac{1}{T} ∫_{0}^{T}ρ_{A}(t, k)\dd{t} = \lim_{T\to
    ∞}\frac{1}{T} ∫_{0}^{T}\abs{\braket{A,k}{ψ(t)}}^{2}\dd{t}.
\end{equation}

\section{Born Approximation}
\label{sec:born-approximation}

In the limit of very weak coupling we can solve for \(ρ_{A}\) in terms
of a non-Markovian master equation by employing perturbation theory to
second order\footnote{Which is the first nontrivial order} in the
coupling \(V\).
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:42}
  \dot{ρ}_{A}(k,t) = ∫_{0}^{t}Σ(k, t-t\prime) ρ_{A}(k, t\prime)
\end{equation}
with the self-energy
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:43}
  Σ(k,t)=-2 ∑_{j}\abs{η_{j}(k)}^{2}\cos((ω_{k}-ω_{A})t)
\end{equation}
with \(j=\overline{1,N}\).

We are interested in the long time average of \(ρ\) which can be
expressed as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:44}
  {ρ}_{A}(k)=\lim_{T\to
    ∞}\frac{1}{T}∫_{0}^{∞}\eu^{-\frac{t}{T}}ρ_{A}(k,t)\dd{t} =
  \lim_{s\to 0} s \tilde{ρ}_{A}(k, s) = \eval{\bqty{\dv{s} \frac{1}{\tilde{ρ}_{A}(k,s)}}^{-1}}_{s=0}
\end{equation}
where \(\tilde{ρ}_{A}({k, s})\) is the Laplace transform of \(ρ_{A}(k,
t)\).

The equation of motion \cref{eq:42} gives direct access to
\(\tilde{ρ}_{A}\)
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:45}
  \tilde{ρ}_{A}({k, s}) = \frac{ρ_{A}(k,0)}{s - \tilde{Σ}(k, s)} = \frac{1}{s - \tilde{Σ}(k, s)},
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:46}
  \tilde{Σ}(k, s) = -2 ∑_{j}\abs{η_{j}}^{2} \frac{s}{s^{2}+(ω_{j}-ω_{A})^{2}} =
  -∑_{j}\abs{η_{j}}^{2} \bqty{\frac{1}{s+\iu (ω_{j}-ω_{A})} + \frac{1}{s-\iu
      (ω_{j}-ω_{A})}}.
\end{equation}

Using \cref{eq:44} and setting \(ω_{A}=0\), this yields
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:47}
  ρ_{A}(k) = \frac{1}{1 + 2∑_{j}\frac{\abs{η_{j}}^{2}}{ω_{j}^{2}}} =
  \frac{1}{1+2 U_{A}}.
\end{equation}

We now assume that the \(η_{j}\) are chosen so that in the continuum
limit \(N\to ∞\)
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:48}
  ∫_{0}^{∞}f(ω)∑_{j}\abs{η_{j}}^{2} δ(ω-ω_{j})^{2}\dd{ω} =
  ∫_{0}^{∞}J(ω) f(ω)
\end{equation}
for arbitrary (smooth) functions \(f\), where \(J\) is called the
spectral density. We make the model assumption
of an ohmic-type spectral density
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:49}
  J(ω) =g_{0}^{2}\frac{α+1}{ω_{c}^{α+1}}
  \begin{dcases}
    ω^{α} & \mathrm{if}\, ω \leq ω_{c},\\
    0 & \mathrm{otherwise}.
  \end{dcases}
\end{equation}
For \(α<(>)1\) this we call \(J\) a sub(super)-Ohmic spectral density,
whereas for \(α=1\) we have an Ohmic spectral density. Let us define
\(J_{α}=g_{0}^{2}\frac{α+1}{ω_{c}^{α+1}}\) for convenience.


The \(ω_{j}\) and \(η_{j}\) may be chosen according to
\cref{sec:discretization-bath}.

In the continuum limit \(U_{A}\to ∞\) for \(α\leq 1\) and remains finite
for \(α>1\), which leads to the \ac{mlong} \(\ev{m}\) having a sharp
transition from \(0\) to \(1\) for \(α\leq 1\) which becomes washed
out for \(α>1\).

We wish to study how this limit is approached with a finite bath and
in finite times. The born approximation requires that \(η\to 0\)
sufficiently fast for \(N\to ∞\) so that the resulting long timescale is
unlikely to be resolved experimentally.

\section{Exact Solution}
\label{sec:exact-solution}

Numerics (see \cref{fig:unshifted_overview}) at finite coupling
strengths suggest that the behavior for the weak coupling limit may
not be naively reproduced in this setting.

\begin{figure}[htp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{plots/overview_unshifted.tikz}
  \caption{\label{fig:unshifted_overview} A numerical simulation for
    \(g_{0}=10^{-2}\). The mean displacement takes on some
    non-universal value and \(ρ_{A}\not{\to} 0\).}
\end{figure}

In the following we will suppress the \(k\) dependence of the
couplings \(η_{j}\).  Perturbation theory suggests that the energy of
the \(\ket{A}\) state changes according to a lamb shift
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  ω_{A} \to ε_{A}^{(2)} = ω_{A} - ∑_{j} \frac{\abs{η_{j}}^{2}}{(ω_{j}-ω_{A})},
\end{equation}
which would make the system insensitive to the spectral density at
\(ω = 0\) unless corrected for.

Let us proceed by writing down the equations of motion for the
coefficients of a general state \(\ket{ψ} = α\ket{A} +
∑_{j}β_{j}\ket{j}\) following from \cref{eq:37}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:2}
  \begin{aligned}
    \iu \dot{α} &= ω_{A}α + ∑_{j} η_{j} β_{j} & \iu \dot{β}_{j} = η_{j}^\ast α
                                       + ω_{i} β_{i}.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Transforming the \(β_{j}\) into a rotating frame with respect to the
\(ω_{i\neq A}\) so that \(\tilde{β}_{i}=β_{i} \eu^{\iu ω_{i}t}\) we obtain
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:3}
  \begin{aligned}
    \iu \dot{α} &= ω_{A}α + ∑_{j} η_{j} \tilde{β}_{j}\eu^{-\iu ω_{j}t}
    & \iu \dot{\tilde{β}}_{j} = η_{j}^\ast α \eu^{\iu ω_{j} t}.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The equations for the \(\tilde{β}_{j}\) can be integrated straight forwardly
to obtain \(\tilde{\beta}_{j} = -\iu η_{j}^{\ast} ∫_{0}^{t}\eu^{\iu ω_{i} τ}
  α(τ) \dd{τ}\) which can be substituted into \cref{eq:3} to find a
  closed equation for \(α\)
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:4}
  \dot{α} = -\iu ω_{A}α - ∫_{0}^{t} Κ(t-τ)α(τ) \dd{τ}
\end{equation}
with \(Κ(t-τ) = ∑_{j} \abs{η_{j}}^{2} \eu^{-\iu ω_{i}
  (t-τ)}\). Laplace transforming both sides of \cref{eq:4} leads us to
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:5}
  \begin{aligned}
  \tilde{α}(s) &= \frac{α(0)}{s+\iu ω_{A} + \tilde{Κ}(s)} &
     \tilde{Κ}(s) &= ∑_{j}\frac{\abs{η_{j}}^{2}}{s + \iu ω_{j}},
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
which is very similar to \cref{eq:45}, save for the explicit
appearance of \(\iu ω_A\). As \cref{eq:45} is related to a probability, it
is real-valued and always has a pole at \(s=0\) independent of
\(ω_{A}\).

The amplitude \(α\) on the other hand can generically be expected to
have the form \(α(t)=∑_{i}α_{i}\eu^{-\iu ε_{i} t}\), where the
\(ε_{i}\) are poles of \(\tilde{α}(s)\) and
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:6}
  α_{i} = \iu \lim_{ε\to ε_{i}} (ε-ε_{i}) \tilde{α}(-\iu ε) =
  \eval{\bqty{\dv{s} \frac{1}{\tilde{α}(-\iu s)}}^{-1}}_{s=ε_{i}} =
  \frac{α(0)}{1 + \tilde{Κ}'(-\iu ε_{i})} = \frac{α(0)}{1+U_{i}}
\end{equation}
are the residues (modulo \(2π\iu\)) of \(\tilde{α}(s)\).

We are however interested in the behaviour of \(ρ_{A}(t) =
\abs{α(t)}^{2} = ∑_{jk}α_{j}α_{k}^\ast \eu^{-\iu (ε_{j} - ε_{k})t}\)
which has the long time average \(ρ_{A} = ∑_{j}
\abs{α_{j}}^{2}\). Therefore we cannot simply calculate the residue at
\(s=0\) as in \cref{sec:born-approximation}, but have to
calculate all \(α_{j}\) in principle.

Again, perturbation theory suggests, that there will be one eigenstate
with great overlap with the \(\ket{A}\) state, close in energy to
\(ω_{A}\). Let us designate the corresponding residual as \(α_{A}\)
and notice that \(\abs{α_{A}}\) forms a lower bound of
\(ρ_{A}(t)\). We can therefore expect that for relatively weak
coupling (which we will make more concrete later), the \(α_{A}\) can
be viewed as a good approximation for \(ρ_{A}\) and as an indicator
for \(ρ_{A}(t) \not\to 0\) in general.

Finding the pole of \(\tilde{α}(s)\), or equivalently the root of
\({s+\iu ω_{A} + \tilde{Κ}(s)}\) close to \(-\iu ω_{A}\) involves
finding the root of a polynomial of potentially high degree and can in
general only be achieved through numerics or perturbation
theory. Further, \cref{fig:unshifted_overview} suggests that we won't
obtain a results similar to the one found in
\cref{sec:born-approximation}.

The solution is to demand the existence of a pole at \(s=0\)
corresponding to \(ε_{A}=0\) and adjusting \(ω_{A}\) accordingly
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:7}
  0 = \iu ω_{A} + \tilde{Κ}(0) \implies ω_{A} = ∑_{j}\frac{\abs{η_{j}}^{2}}{ε_{j}}
\end{equation}
which is only consistent with the expression obtained using
second-order perturbation theory\footnote{and therefore the Born
  approximation in the current context} \cref{eq:7} only for
\(∑_{j}{\abs{η_{j}}^{2}}/{ω_{j}^{2}}\ll 1\) and \(\abs{ω_{A}} \ll ω_{j}\).

Using \cref{eq:6,eq:7} and we can conclude that
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:8}
  U_{A} = ∑_{j}\frac{\abs{η_{j}}^{2}}{ω_{j}^{2}} \implies ρ_{A}≥ \abs{α_{A}}^{2}
  = \frac{α(0)}{(1+U_{A})^{2}},
\end{equation}
which is compatible with \cref{eq:47} for \(U_{A}\ll 1\) as already
stated in the previous paragraph.

It is to be stressed, that \cref{eq:8} is an exact result and exhibits
the same behavior as the result from \cref{sec:born-approximation}, as
the values for \(U_{A}\) obtained are identical. On the other hand, we
are interested in the case where \(U_{A}\to ∞\) where the
compatibility with the Born approximation should be broken. One could
however imagine, that there is the possibility of \(U_{A}\gg 1\) while
\(ω_{A}\ll ω_{c} \implies ε_{A}^{(2)}\approx ε_{A} \approx 0\) so that
the two methods converge again at sufficiently low coupling strength
and large bath size.

% This can, in fact, be achieved. Consider the first bath level to have
% energy \(ω_{1} = ε\). According to \cref{sec:discretization-bath}, we
% can assign it a coupling
% \(η_{j}^{2} = ∫_{0}^{ε}J(ω)\dd{ω} \approx J(ε/2)ε\). Considering only
% this first bath mode, as it is going to have the greatest influence in
% the sums above for \(ε\ll ω_{c}\) (\(N\to ∞\)) and
% \(g_{0}\ll ω_{c}^{2}\), we can approximate
% \begin{equation}
%   \label{eq:9}
%   \begin{aligned}
%   \frac{ω_{A}}{ω_{c}} &\sim \frac{g_{0}^{2}(α+1)}{ω_{c}^{α+2} 2^{α}} ε^{α} & U_{A}
%     &\sim  \frac{g_{0}^{2}(α+1)}{ω_{c}^{α+1} 2^{α}} ε^{α-1}.
%   \end{aligned}
% \end{equation}
% When \(α<1\), we have \({ω_{A}}/{ω_{c}}\to 0\) while \(U_{A}\to ∞\)
% for \(ε\to 0\)
% fulfilling \cref{eq:1} as well as \cref{eq:7}.

However, in the continuum limit
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:10}
  ω_{A} = ∫_{0}^{ω_{c}}\frac{J(ω)}{ω} = J_{α}\frac{ω_{c}^{α}}{α}.
\end{equation}
Using this in \cref{eq:46} and taking the limit \(g_{0}\to 0\) leads
to \(ρ_{A}\to 1\), whereas \cref{eq:8} would suggest \(ρ_{A}\to
0\). Therefore the weak coupling limit has to be taken at the same
time as the continuum limit to achieve consistency. \emph{I have to
  think more about that.} This is sensible, as the transition
\(U_{A}\to ∞\) may well be non-analytic in \(g_{0}\).

\subsection{Strong Coupling Limit}
\label{sec:strong-coupl-limit}

In the strong coupling limit
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:14}
  ∑_{j}\abs{η_{j}}^{2} \gg ω_{c}^{2}
\end{equation}
we can find an effective two-level system behavior in the model
\cref{eq:37}.

Starting from the eigenvalue equations
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:11}
    ω_{A} α + ∑_{j} η_{j} β_{j} &= E α \\
    ω_{j} β_{j} + η_{j} α &= E β_{j} \label{eq:12}
\end{align}
and substituting \cref{eq:12} into \cref{eq:11} to obtain
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:12}
  E = ω_{A} + Σ(E) = ω_{A} + ∑_{j}\frac{\abs{η_{j}}^{2}}{E-ω_{j}}
\end{equation}
which should be familiar from \cref{eq:5}. We can now expect some
energy eigenvalues \(E\) close to the bath energies \(ω_{j}\), but
level repulsion will produce states with a large overlap with
\(\ket{A}\) that have energies outside of this ``continuum'' as is
demonstrated in \cref{fig:spectrum_strong_coupling_limit}.
\begin{figure}[htp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.49\linewidth]{plots/spectrum_weak_couplign_limit.tikz}
  \includegraphics[width=.49\linewidth]{plots/spectrum_stong_couplign_limit.tikz}
  \caption{\label{fig:spectrum_strong_coupling_limit} The spectrum of
    the model in \cref{fig:unshifted_overview} for two different
    coupling strengths. The bars show the overlap
    \(\abs{\braket{A}{E}}^{2}\) of the eigenstate \(\ket{E}\) at
    energy \(E\) with the \(\ket{A}\) state.}
\end{figure}

Assuming \(\abs{E}\gg ω_{c} \implies \abs{E} \gg ω_{j}\) we can
neglect the \(ω_{j}\) in \cref{eq:12} to obtain
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:13}
  E_{\pm} = \frac{1}{2}\bqty{ω_{A}\pm \sqrt{ω_{A}^{2} + 4 ∑_{k}\abs{η_{j}}^{2}}}.
\end{equation}
For \(ω_{A} = 0\) this becomes \(E_{\pm}=\pm\sqrt{∑_{j}\abs{η_{j}}^{2}}\) which
leads to the criterion \cref{eq:14}.

The corresponding eigenvectors are (modulo normalization)
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:15}
  \ket{\pm} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + ∑_{j}
      \abs{\frac{η_{j}}{E_{\pm}-ω_{j}}}^{2}}}\bqty{\ket{A} +
    ∑_{j} \frac{η_{j}^\ast}{E_{\pm}-ω_{j}}\ket{j}}\approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\bqty{\ket{A} +
    ∑_{j} \frac{η_{j}^\ast}{E_{\pm}}\ket{j}}
\end{equation}
where the second approximate equality follows from
\(\abs{E}\gg \abs{ω_{A}}\). Together they form a complete orthonormal
basis of the subspace of the Eigenspace of the Hamiltonian that
contains \(\ket{A}\) of the equal overlap with \(\ket{A}\).

A state \(\ket{ψ(t)}\) with
\(\ket{ψ(0)}=\ket{A} = (\ket{+} + \ket{-})/\sqrt{2}\) will oscillate
between \((\ket{+} \pm \ket{-})/\sqrt{2}\) with angular frequency
\(2\abs{E_{\pm}}\) and thus
\(ρ_{A}(k,t)=\cos[2](E_{+}t)=\cos[2](E_{-}t) \implies ρ_{A}(k) =
1/2\). The \ac{mlong} will then exhibit a universal behavior
irrespective of the spectral density
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:16}
  \ev{m} =
  \begin{cases}
    1 & \mathrm{if}\, u>1,\\
    0 & \mathrm{if}\, u<1.
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

This behavior can be exploited to store quantum information
\textbf{Reference?} by allowing for an oscillation to transfer all of
the state weight into the bath decoupling from the \(\ket{A}\)
state. The free evolution of the \(\ket{j}\) states is then reversed
at some point and the bath is re-coupled to the \(\ket{A}\) state,
transferring all weight into it.



\section{A Criterion for the Bath Size}
\label{sec:criterion-bath-size}
Looking back at \cref{eq:8}, we would like to find an estimate for the
number of bath modes needed in the limit of number of bath states
\(N\) being moderately large.

In this limit, employing a constant density of states, we have \(η_{j}^{2} = J_{α} ω_{j}^{α}\) and \(ω_{j}=jω_{c}/N\) and can readily
calculate
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:17}
  U_{A} = ∑_{j}\frac{η_{j}^{2}}{ω_{j}^{2}} = J_{α}
  \frac{ω_{C}}{N}∑_{j}{ω_{j}^{α-2}}= g_{0}^{2} \frac{α+1}{ω_{c}^{2}}
  N^{1-α} ∑_{j} j^{α-2}.
\end{equation}
For \(1/N\) sufficiently smaller than \(1\) we can approximate the sum
in
\cref{eq:17} as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:18}
  N^{1-α} ∑_{j} j^{α-2} \approx \frac{g_{0}^{2} (α+1)}{ω_{c}^{2}} \pqty{N^{1-α}ζ(2-α) + \frac{1}{α-1}}.
\end{equation}
Demanding that \(ρ_{A}\approx \abs{α_{A}}^{2}\) takes on a particular
value for a given \(α\) yields
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:19}
  N = \bqty{\pqty{\frac{ω_{c}^{2}}{g_{0}^{2}}\frac{\pqty{\abs{α_{A}}^{-1}-1}}{(α+1)}+\frac{1}{1-α}}\frac{1}{ζ(2-α)}}^{\frac{1}{1-α}}.
\end{equation}

The expression \cref{eq:19} in monotonous in \(\abs{α_{A}}\) and thus
choosing an \(N\) such that \(\eval{ρ_{A}}_{α=α_{0}}\) implies that
\(\eval{ρ_{A}}_{{α}<α_{0}} \leq \eval{ρ_{A}}_{α=α_{0}}\).

Furthermore, at \(α\approx 1\) we can estimate
\(ζ(2-α)\approx 1/(1-α)\) and thus
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:20}
  N \approx \pqty{ \frac{ω_{c}^{2}}{g_{0}^{2}}\pqty{\abs{α_{A}}^{-1}-1}\cdot
      \frac{1-α}{1+α}+1}^{\frac{1}{1-α}} \xrightarrow{α\to 1} \eu^{\frac{ω_{c}^{2}}{2g_{0}^{2}}\pqty{\abs{α_{A}}^{-1}-1}}
\end{equation}
showing that for the sharp phase diagram presented in
\refcite{Ricottone2020} exponentially many modes are required for a
fixed coupling strength.

As for \(N\gg 1\) all discretization methods become equivalent, this
result is useful to estimate when \(N\) becomes prohibitively
large. In the case where \(N\sim 100\) or smaller using a different
density of states and the discretization methods described in
\cref{sec:discretization-bath} may pay off.
